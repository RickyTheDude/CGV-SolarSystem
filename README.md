# Interactive 3D Solar System Simulation 🔭

A 3D simulation of our solar system created for educational purposes as part of the CGV mini-project. The simulation allows users to explore the solar system with realistic planetary motion and visuals.

## Features

- Interactive 3D visualization of the solar system with the Sun and 8 planets
- Realistic orbital mechanics with proper revolution speeds
- Planet-specific texture mapping and bump mapping
- Saturn's rings with transparency and proper illumination
- Dynamic camera controls for exploration
- Ability to lock-in camera into planets/Sun implemented through Ray Casting

## Tech Stack

- Three.js - 3D rendering library for the web
- WebGL - Web Graphics Library for hardware-accelerated rendering
- JavaScript ES6+ - Core programming language
- HTML5/CSS3 - Structure and styling

## Computer Graphics Concepts Implemented

- **3D Modeling and Rendering** - Creation and display of 3D sphere geometries
- **Texture Mapping** - Application of image textures to 3D objects
- **Bump Mapping** - Simulation of small-scale surface details without adding geometry
- **Normal Mapping** - Enhanced surface detail through normal vector manipulation
- **Skybox/Environment Mapping** - Cubemap background for realistic space environment
- **Bloom Effects** - Post-processing for light glow around bright objects
- **Camera Controls** - Orbital camera implementation for scene navigation
- **Raycasting** - Object selection through screen-to-world ray projection

## Installation and Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/RickyTheDude/CGV-SolarSystem.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd CGV-SolarSystem
   ```

3. Open with a live server:
   - Using VS Code: Install "Live Server" extension and click "Go Live"
   - Using npm: `npm install -g live-server && live-server`

4. The simulation should open in your default browser.

## Controls

- **Left-click + drag**: Orbit the camera
- **Right-click + drag**: Pan the camera
- **Scroll wheel**: Zoom in/out
- **Click on a planet**: Focus on that planet
- **Double-click empty space**: Reset focus to the Sun
